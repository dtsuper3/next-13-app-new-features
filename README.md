Next.js 13 - Server Components
One of the major new features in Next.js 13 is Server Components. This feature allows you to split your application logic between the server and the client, making it easier to create dynamic, interactive web applications.

With Server Components, you can define components that are executed on the server, and then rendered on the client. This can help reduce the amount of JavaScript that needs to be sent to the client, improving the performance and speed of your application.

Server Components also make it easier to share code between the server and the client, and can simplify the process of creating complex, data-intensive applications.

Some benefits of Server Components in Next.js 13 include:

Reduced JavaScript payload
Faster page loads
Improved performance on low-powered devices
Easier sharing of code between the server and client
Simplified development of complex, data-intensive applications
Overall, Server Components is a powerful new feature that can help improve the performance and development experience of your web application.
